	</header>
	<body>
		<p>The <link href="&hivedoc;/config/hivemind.Translators.html">Translators</link>
			configuration defines the translators that may be used with XML conversion
			rules.</p>
		<p>Contributions are of the form:</p>
		<source><![CDATA[
<translator name="..." class="..." service-id="..."/>]]> </source>
		<p>Only one of <code>class</code> and <code>service-id</code> attributes should be 
			specified. The former is the complete name of a class (implementing the 
			<link href="&apiroot;/schema/Translator.html">Translator</link> interface). It 
			should have a no-args and/or single String constructor.	The second is used to 
			contribute a service (which must also implement the interface).</p>
		<p>Names of translators must be unique; it is not possible to override the
			existing service model translators. A single translator, <code>class</code>,
			is hard-coded into HiveMind, the others appear as ordinary contributions.</p>

    <title>hivemind.ThreadLocalStorage Service</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>The <link href="&hivedoc;/service/hivemind.ThreadLocalStorage.html"> ThreadLocalStorage</link> service implements the <link href="&apiroot;/service/ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</link> interface. This service acts as a kind of Map for temporary data. The map is local to the current thread, and is cleared at the end of the transaction.</p>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that keys are unique, typically by prefixing them with a module id or package name.</p>
    <warning> ThreadLocalStorage is likely to be removed in a future release of HiveMind. It is advised that you use the threaded service model instead. </warning>

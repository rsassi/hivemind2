   <body>
		
      <p>The <a href="hivedocs/config/hivemind.SymbolSources.html">
			SymbolSources</a> configuration is used to define new <a href="apidocs/org/apache/hivemind/SymbolSource.html">SymbolSource</a>s (providers of
			values for substitution symbols).</p>
		
      <p>Contributions are of the form:</p>
		
      <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;source name="..." before="..." after="..." class="..." service-id="..."/&gt;	</source>
		<p>Sources are ordering based on the <code>name</code>, <code>before</code> 
			and <code>after</code> elements. <code>before</code> and <code>after</code>
			may be comma-seperated lists of other sources, may be the simple value 
			<code>*</code>, or may be omitted.</p>
		<p>Only one of <code>class</code> and <code>service-id</code> attributes
			should be specified. The former is the complete name of a class
			(implementing the SymbolSource interface). The second is used to
			contribute a service (which must also implement the interface).</p>

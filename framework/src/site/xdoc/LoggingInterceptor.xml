      <p>
The
<a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.LoggingInterceptor.html">LoggingInterceptor</a>
service is used to add logging capability to a service, i.e.:
</p>


      <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;interceptor service-id="hivemind.LoggingInterceptor"&gt;
  &lt;include method="..."/&gt;
  &lt;exclude method="..."/&gt;    
&lt;/interceptor&gt;</source>	


<p>
The service make take parameters (which control which methods will be logged).	
</p>

<p>
The logging interceptor uses a <code>Log</code>	 derived from the service id (of
the service to which logging is being added).
</p>

<p>
The service logs, at debug level, the following events:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Method entry (with parameters)</li>	
<li>Method exit (with return value, if applicable)</li>
<li>Thrown exceptions (checked and runtime)</li>
</ul>	


<p>
By default, the interceptor will log all methods. By supplying parameters to the interceptor,
you can control exactly
which methods should be logged.  The <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> parameter
elements specify methods to be included (logged) and excluded (not logged).
The <code>method</code> attribute is a
<em>method pattern</em>, a string used to match methods based on name, number of parameters, or type
of parameters; see  the
<a href="apidocs/org/apache/hivemind/methodmatch/MethodMatcher.html">MethodMatcher</a> class for more details.
</p>

<p>
A method which does not match any supplied pattern <em>will</em> be logged.
</p>

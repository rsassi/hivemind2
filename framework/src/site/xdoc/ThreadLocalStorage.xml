   <body>
    
      <p>The <a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a> service implements the <a href="apidocs/org/apache/hivemind/service/ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a> interface. This service acts as a kind of Map for temporary data. The map is local to the current thread, and is cleared at the end of the transaction.</p>
    
      <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that keys are unique, typically by prefixing them with a module id or package name.</p>
    
      <p>
         <strong>Warning:</strong>
         <br/> ThreadLocalStorage is likely to be removed in a future release of HiveMind. It is advised that you use the threaded service model instead. </p>

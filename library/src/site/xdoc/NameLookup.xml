      <p>
The <a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.lib.NameLookup.html">NameLookup</a>
service is a thin wrapper around JNDI lookup.  It is used by
the <a href="site:hivemind.lib.EJBProxyFactory">EJBProxyFactory</a> service to locate
EJBs.
</p>


      <p>The implementation makes use of three symbols (all of whose values default 
  to null):</p>

      <ul>

         <li>java.naming.factory.initial</li>	

         <li>java.naming.factory.url.pkgs</li>

         <li>java.naming.provider.url</li>

      </ul>



      <p>
By supplying overrides of these values, it is possible to configure how the NameLookup service
generates the InitialContext used for performing the JNDI lookup.
</p>

      <p>The <a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.lib.RemoteExceptionCoordinator.html">
			RemoteExceptionCoordinator</a> is used to propogate notifications of
			remote exceptions throughout the HiveMind repository. When any individual
			service encounters a remote exception, it notifies all listeners, who
			release all remote object proxies.</p>
		
      <p>The service interface, <a href="../hivemind/apidocs/org/apache/hivemind/lib/RemoteExceptionCoordinator.html">RemoteExceptionCoordinator</a>, allows objects
			that implement the <a href="../hivemind/apidocs/org/apache/hivemind/lib/RemoteExceptionListener.html">RemoteExceptionListener</a> interface to be
			registered for notification, and includes a method for firing
			notifications.</p>

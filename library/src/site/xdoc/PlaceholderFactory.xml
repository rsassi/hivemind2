      <p>The <a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.lib.PlaceholderFactory.html"> 
      PlaceholderFactory</a> service is a service implementation factory 
      that uses the <a href="site:hivemind.lib.DefaultImplementationBuilder">DefaultImplementationBuilder</a> 
      service to create placeholder implementations for services. Placeholders 
      do nothing at all.</p>

      <p>The <a href="hivedocs/service/hivemind.lib.ChainFactory.html">ChainFactory</a> service implementation 
      factory is based on <a href="site:hivemind.lib.ChainBuilder">hivemind.lib.ChainBuilder</a>. The chain's command interface is the service interface, and the 
      service parameters identify the configuration that identifies the chain of commands. </p>
    
      <section name="Usage">
      
      
         <p> The factory expects a single parameter element: </p>
      
         <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;construct configuration-id="..."/&gt;      
      </source>
      <p>The configuration-id identifies a configuration that implements the <a href="hivedocs/schema/hivemind.lib.ChainContribution.html">hivemind.lib.ChainContribution</a> schema. </p>
    </section>
    
      <section name="Configuration">
      
      
         <p> The configuration identifies the command objects that form the chain, including the order of the commands: 
        </p>
      
         <source xml:space="preserve"> 
&lt;command id="..." before="..." after="..." object="..."/&gt;
 </source>
      <p> Each command has an id (which is qualified with the module id) and may specify a list of commands which 
        precede or follow it. </p>
      <p> The object is specified as an <a href="../hivemind/hivedocs/config/ObjectProviders.html">object reference</a>. </p>

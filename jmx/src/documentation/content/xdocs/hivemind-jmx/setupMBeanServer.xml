    <title>Connect to MBeanServer</title>
  </header>
  <body>
  <p>
	A running MBean Server is needed in your application. It is
	the central registry for all MBeans of your application. 
	The JMX specification requires a JMX implementation to provide 
	a factory (javax.management.MBeanServerFactory) for finding running 
	servers and starting new ones.	
	</p>
	<p>HiveMind uses MBeanServerFactory to find a running server at first. 
	That one could be provided by an application server or servlet 
	engine (like Tomcat 5) or your J2SE 1.5 runtime environment. 
	If multiple implementations are available in your environment 
	the classpath and classloader hierarchy finally decide which 
	implementation is used. 
	Add these lines to your module descriptor:

  <p>
	Connecting to a running server results in a unified management of infrastructure mbeans 
	and your applications mbeans. Infrastructure mbeans are for example the
	J2SE 1.5 MBeans for instrumentation of the JMX (GarbageCollector, MemoryManager etc.).
	If no running server is found, a new one is started.

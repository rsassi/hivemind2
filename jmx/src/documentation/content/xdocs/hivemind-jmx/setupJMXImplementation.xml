    <title>Choose JMX implementation</title>
  </header>
  <body>
  	<p>First of all you have to choose how all the JMX infrastructure
  		is provided. Various JMX implementations are freely available.</p>
  	<p>HiveMind uses <link href="http://mx4j.sourceforge.net" >MX4J</link>  
			for development and testing, but it can run with any other JMX 1.2 
			implementation. HiveMind has additionally been tested with 
			J2SE 1.5 and the Sun Reference Implementation of JMX.
		</p>
		<section>
			<title>MX4J</title>
			<p>Get MX4J <link href="http://mx4j.sourceforge.net" >here</link>
				in version 2.x or grab the libraries from the ext-package/lib 
				folder after an ant build of HiveMind</p>
			<p>Add mx4j.jar, mx4j-tools.jar to the classpath. Add mx4j-remote.jar only if you use JSR 160 connectors. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>J2SE 1.5</title>
			<p>If your application runs with Sun J2SE 1.5 no additional libraries are needed
				This can change later if you decide to use HTTP to manage your application.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Sun Reference Implementation</title>
			<p>The Sun RI can be downloaded <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/download.html">here</link>
				in version 1.2.1
			</p>
			<p>Add jmxri.jar and jmxtools.jar to the classpath.

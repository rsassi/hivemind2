  <body>
  	<p>The interceptor PerformanceMonitor collects statistical data about calls to 
  		a service. The results are sent to a newly created mbean. For each 
  		service method it displays: number of calls, maximum, minimum, average and last 
  		execution duration.<br/>
  		Add the Interceptor to your service and choose which methods
  		are to be intercepted by inclusion and exclusion:</p>

			<xmlsource><![CDATA[
<service-point id="Calculator" 
    interface="org.apache.hivemind.management.Calculator">
  <invoke-factory>
    <construct class="org.apache.hivemind.management.CalculatorImpl" />
  </invoke-factory>
  <interceptor service-id="hivemind.management.PerformanceMonitorFactory">
    <exclude method="getSum"/>
    <include method="add"/>
    <include method="subtract"/>
  </interceptor>
</service-point>]]></xmlsource>
	<p>
		The statistics are displayed by a MBean named like your service, 
		with an additional name part "decorator=PerformanceCollector":<br/><br/>
		<img src="images/performanceInterceptorMBean.png" alt="Performance Interceptor MBean"></img>
	</p>
	<note>
		By default a service - and thus it's interceptors - is created 
		on the first call of a service method. If you want to get the
		performance mbean at startup, add your service to the EagerLoad contribution.

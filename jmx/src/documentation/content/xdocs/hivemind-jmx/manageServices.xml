    <title>Manage HiveMind services via JMX</title>
  </header>
  <body>
  	<p>Actually it is possible to make any HiveMind service 
  		manageable with JMX. 
  		An existing service can be registered as MBean easily by a contribution 
  		to "mbeans":
  		</p>
			<source><![CDATA[
<contribution configuration-id="hivemind.management.mbeans" >
    <mbean service-id="test.management.Calculator" />
</contribution>]]></source>
			<p>Now all properties and operations of the service interface
				are accessible via JMX. Be aware, that this makes sense
				only for a certain set of supported datatypes.<br/>
				The service must use the primitive or singleton service model.</p>
			<p>If you want to register a MBean that implements one of the 
				standard mbean interfaces like DynamicMBean oder ModelMBean, define
				the MBean as service and register it the same way:</p>
			<source><![CDATA[
<service-point id="MyMBean" interface="javax.management.DynamicMBean">
  <invoke-factory model="primitive">
    ...
  </invoke-factory>  	
</service-point>

<contribution configuration-id="hivemind.management.mbeans" >
  <mbean service-id="MyMBean" />
</contribution>]]></source>
  </body>
</document>

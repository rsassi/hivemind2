	<p>
	The HiveMind JMX library brings the benefits of mature application management 
	and monitoring to your HiveMind based applications by integration of
	the 
	<link href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement">Java Management Extension (JMX)</link>.
	</p>
	<p>With minimal effort you can reach these goals, for example:
    	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Change log levels in your running application via a web based interface
			or by use of a management console</li>
		<li>Measure the performance of middleware calls and view the data online</li>
		<li>Make your services configurable at runtime. Change database urls or cache sizes</li>
	</ul>	

	<p>
		The services of this library are implemented in the module 
	<link href="&hivedoc;/module/hivemind.management.html">hivemind.management</link>
	</p>
	<p>Start <link href="site:quickstart">here</link> for a JMX quickstart or read

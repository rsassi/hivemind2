	</header>
	<body>

<p>
HiveMind distributions are available from the
<fork href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_hivemind.cgi">Apache Mirrors</fork>.  
HiveMind is packaged somewhat differently than most other Apache projects, in that the main
distribution includes binary <em>and</em> source, but that documentation is seperate:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hivemind-</code><em>release</em><code>.tar.gz</code> -- Combined binary/source distribution</li>	
<li><code>hivemind-</code><em>release</em><code>.zip</code> -- Combined binary/source distribution (about twice the size of the .tar.gz)</li>
<li><code>hivemind-</code><em>release</em><code>-docs.tar.gz</code> -- The HiveMind documentation (the same as this site)</li>
</ul>
	
<p>
Each file also has a MD5 checksum file, so you can verify that what you download is valid, and a GPG key (.asc)
to further verify that there has been no tampering.
</p>
	
<warning>
Under Internet Explorer, the .tar.gz files do not download with the correct file name.  Download them, rename
them to .tar.gz and then open them using WinZip.	
</warning>

		<p>HiveMind includes tools for documentating a HiveMind registry ... the
			combined information from all modules that are deployed at runtime. At
			build time, all related HiveMind module deployment descriptors are parsed
			and the results combined into a single file. The master file (which is
			only used for this documentation) is then converted into a set of HTML
			files using XSLT. The end result is much like JavaDoc ... it's fully
			hyperlinked and allows you to see all services, configuration points,
			contributions and schemas clearly.</p>

    Incorporated into the generated documentation is user-supplied descriptions. The
    &attribute;, &configuration-point;, &element;, &module;, &schema; and
    &service-point; elements can enclose a description (as character data), i.e.:

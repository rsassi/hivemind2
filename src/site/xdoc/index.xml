	    <div>HiveMind 2 is a complete refactoring of HiveMind 1.
	     The Refactoring was mainly done to support alternative ways of
	     defining a registry and its services and configuration points.
	     <br/>
	     New features:
	     <ul>
	       <li>Pure Java Registry Definition API</li>
	       <li>Annotation Based Definition API (Annotated modules)</li>
	       <li>Extensible Autowiring Service</li>
	       <li>Arbitrary Configuration Types</li>
	     </ul>  
	    </div>
      <div style="border-color: red; border-style:solid; border-width: 1px; color:red; padding:1em; padding-left: 2em; background-image: url(./images/icon_warning_sml.gif); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: 5px 1em; ">
				HiveMind 2 is currently in alpha stage. New documentation is 
				created on the <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/HIVEMIND2/">wiki</a>.
				Meanwhile you may have a look at the <a href="http://hivemind.apache.org/hivemind1">HiveMind 1 documentation</a>.	
				<br/>
				Moreover be aware, that the new APIs are still subject to change.
